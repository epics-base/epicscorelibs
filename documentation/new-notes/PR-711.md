### CA Client Library Enhancement

GitHub [PR #711](https://github.com/epics-base/epics-base/pull/711)

* Allow CA clients to determine a server's protocol version.

  Adds a call to the CA client API that allows a client to determine the
  server's protocol minor version number.
  This is needed to allow the ca-nameserver to report a server's protocol
  version correctly to a client.

* `ca_host_minor_protocol()` return for disconnected channels

  `ca_host_minor_protocol()` now explicitly returns `CA_UKN_MINOR_VERSION`
  for a disconnected channel.
