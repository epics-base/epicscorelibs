### Avoid early expiration of timers on non-RTOS

Previously, the epicsTimer code rounded down user requested delays by subtracting one half
of the sleep "quantum".
On RTEMS and vxWorks, this allowed periodic timers which expired on every tick.
However, this also resulted in
timers expiring slightly [earlier than requested](https://github.com/epics-base/epics-base/issues/106).

With [PR 744](https://github.com/epics-base/epics-base/pull/744)
rounding is only done for RTEMS and vxWorks, which still have tick timers.

This effects several facilities which use epicsTimer, including record delays.  eg. `calcout.ODLY` becomes more [accurate](https://github.com/epics-base/epics-base/issues/106#issuecomment-1260232765).
